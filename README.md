Creating a model to upgrade the detection models to a diagnosis modelling for multi ophthalmic diseases

Machine learning programs are helping doctors diagnose and classify ailments. Transfer Learning, Ensemble learning and various NN architectures are used to arch the anchor. Neural networks may improve eye illness detection, diagnosis, and treatment. We trained and piloted a neural network model to recognize and differentiate these features on 4,217 color fundus pictures of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, and normal features and compared its accuracy and precision to prior models' performance metrics. The code implements a fine-tuning approach for initial detection model by using and finding the best among transfer learning with VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121, ensemble learning using a version of VGG16 & ResNet50, GridSearchCV & Ensemble learning for image classification on a dataset of color fundus pictures tagged for diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and normal eyes.

 However, detection models are unique and a lot of variations are present, a try to create a diagnosis model has been made to diagnose a binary output for the diseases, after detection is made.
